# ProcessWire Issue Reports

Thank you for helping to identify issues in ProcessWire. We manage issues from this separate 
repository so that we can maintain a collaborative team to assist with issue reports. 

- Submit ProcessWire issue reports to the issues repository:
  [processwire-issues](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues/issues)
  
- Please do not submit feature requests to the issues repository, instead use the requests repository:
  [processwire-requests](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-requests/issues)
  
- Please do not use the issues repository for ProcessWire support, instead use the support forum:  
  <https://processwire.com/talk/>
  
- Always include the full ProcessWire version (i.e. 3.0.34). Also include the PHP or MySQL version 
  when potentially applicable. 

- Indicate any 3rd party modules that are installed. 

- When possible please confirm the issue on a separate installation before submitting 
  an issue report.
  
- When the issue is resolved, please close it.
