# Contributing to the ProcessWire issues repository

Thank you for taking the time to identify issues in ProcessWire. :+1:

We manage issues from this separate repository so that we can maintain a collaborative team to assist with issue reports. The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repository. These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a [pull request](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues/pulls).

## Code of conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [github@processwire.com](mailto:github@processwire.com).

## Before submitting a bug report

There is a good chance that you don’t need to create a bug report in the first place. Please check the following list:

* When possible please **confirm the issue on a separate installation** before submitting an issue report.
* Please **do not submit feature requests**, instead use the [requests repository](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-requests/issues).
* Please **do not use this repository for ProcessWire support**, instead use the [support forum](https://processwire.com/talk/).
* **Check the [FAQs on the forum](https://processwire.com/talk/forum/6-faqs/)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aprocesswire)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

## How to submit a (good) bug report

Always include as many details as possible. There is an [issue template](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) which gets used automatically when you create a new issue. Please use it as it contains all the information needed for a good bug report.

This will help maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, find related reports, and get to a solution more quickly and efficiently.
